## Mortgage Occupancy Types

When applying for a mortgage, you must specify one of the following occupancy types:

- **Primary Residence:**
  You will live in the property as your main home. Even if this is not your
first home, if living in it full time, it is considered your primary.

- **Second Home:**
  You will use the property for personal use, separate from your primary residence. You may not use rental income to offset the future payment.

- **Investment Property:**
  You will be renting the property to others. You may potentially use the proposed rental income for qualifying purposes in most cases.
