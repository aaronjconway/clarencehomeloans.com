# Why Other Lenders Aren't Telling You the Whole Truth About VA Loan Rates

Some lenders advertise ultra-low rates to grab your attention — but there’s a catch.

They’ll flash a **5.00% rate** in bold, but the fine print reveals it’s based on a **15-year term**, perfect credit, and a massive down payment. Others promise rates they can’t actually lock in — by the time you're ready to move forward, the rate has mysteriously changed.

This isn’t just misleading. It’s **borderline fraud**.

We'll never do this to you.
