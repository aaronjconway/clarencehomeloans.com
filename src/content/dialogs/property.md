## Condo vs. Townhome

When buying a home, it's important to understand the key differences between condos and townhomes:

- **Condo (Condominium):**
  Can have complications if not researched correctly.

  You own only the interior of the unit. The building structure, land, and shared spaces (like hallways, gym, or pool) are owned collectively by all residents. The homeowners association (HOA) handles exterior maintenance and amenities, which often results in higher HOA fees.

- **Townhome (Townhouse):**
  Virtually the same as a single family home - just attached.

  You own both the interior and exterior of the unit, including the roof and the land it sits on. Townhomes usually share one or two walls with neighbors and often have lower HOA fees, but you are responsible for more maintenance.
