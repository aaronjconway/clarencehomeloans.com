The [Nationwide Multistate Licensing System & Registry (NMLS)](https://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org/) allows consumers to verify anyoneâ€™s licensing through its consumer access portal.

Each year, brokers must complete numerous hours of continuing education to stay informed and maintain accuracy when assisting consumers. However, banks are not required to undergo this additional educational process.

## State Specific Licensing

State-specific licensing requirements vary to ensure brokers understand local regulations and market conditions. These rules help protect consumers by ensuring compliance with state laws, which banks are not always subject to.
